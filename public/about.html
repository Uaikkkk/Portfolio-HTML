<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> I was born in January 1, 1996 in a small village called <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Rantauprapat,+Rantau+Utara,+Labuhan+Batu+Regency,+North+Sumatra,+Indonesia/@2.1029195,99.8245509,2170m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x302da1e8b6c34ee5:0x3a335df4112b0f46!8m2!3d2.1051078!4d99.8278387!16s%2Fm%2F051xhjk?entry=ttu">Rantau Prapat</a>, Sumatra Utara, Indonesia.</p>

<p>I went to the closest city from my village, so that I could get a better education and managed to graduate from my high school <a href="https://sutomo-mdn.sch.id/sutomo1-sma">Sutomo-1 Medan</a>
  in 2013. After graduating, I decided to go to <a href="https://www.ucd.ie/quinn/aboutus/globalcampus/singapore/">University College Dublin in Singapore</a> to continue for my college degree. 
  I took Finance and Accounting, but the main reason I want to be in Singapore is to improve my English 
  speaking skills while also exposing myself to a more diverse and international environment. After, I have 
  graduated from my university in Singapore, I have become fluent in speaking English and wanted to learn one more new language. 
  So, I finally decided to come to Japan and started learning basic Japanese for one year in a Japanese language school called 
  <a href="https://abk-institute.org/en/school/">The Asian Student Culture Association</a>. Then, I continued going to 
  <a href="https://www.nodai.ac.jp/english/">Tokyo University of Agriculture</a> to learn more about agribusiness. 
</p>

<p>
  Now, I am working with <a href="https://7gr.co.jp/en/">Seven Global Remit</a>  in promoting 
  a remittance transfer app called <a href="https://sendy-app.com/en/">Sendy</a>. 
  My main responsibilities are translation/interpretation (English, Japanese and Bahasa Indonesia), 
  marketing, sales, customer service and the app development. 
  While working on this project, my interest towards IT industry keeps on growing. Thus, I am planning to transition into the IT world by taking my first step in learning the basics through online classes.
